# Learning Design Patterns with a book "Head First: Design Patterns"

Before reading this book I decided to get familiar with Java syntax, so I checked some online tutorials and ended up reading a free book by Syncfusion https://www.syncfusion.com/succinctly-free-ebooks/java-succinctly-part-1

So the plan is to:
1. complete that book
2. finish the second 
3. and start reading the Head First book

This repository is more like a blog about my progress.
